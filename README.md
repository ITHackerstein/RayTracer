# Hackerstein's Ray Tracer

### What
This is a simple ray tracer that I built by reading the series of books in https://raytracing.github.io/.
This is how far I've got:
- [x] RayTracing In One Weekend (complete)
- [x] RayTracing The Next Week (missing rectangles and volumes)
- [ ] RayTracing The Rest of Your Life

### Why
I'm building this ray tracer to learn more about computer graphics and possibly some of the physics and math behind it.

### Acknowledgments
In this ray tracer I'm using these 3rd party libraries:
* [TOML++](https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/) to read and parse TOML files which are used as scene files
* [PCG](https://www.pcg-random.org/) to generate random numbers efficiently
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to load image files

### Things that I'm looking forward to implement or add to the repo
* A good documentation
* Some sample scenes
* Support for Windows
